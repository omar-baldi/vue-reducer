## About

_**vue-reducers-hooks**_, inspired by Redux, is a package designed specifically for Vue applications. It provides two powerful composables/hooks that facilitate handling state in a Redux-like manner:

- **useReducer**: a composable that allows you to manage state using a reducer function, providing a simple and predictable way to update state based on actions.

- **useCombineReducers**: a composable that enables you to combine multiple reducers into a single state management function, making it easier to manage complex state across different parts of your application.

## Getting Started

Install with npm:
`npm i vue-reducers-hooks`
